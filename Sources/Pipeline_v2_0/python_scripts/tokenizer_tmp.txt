You are an expert in generating Java production assertions. Your task is to generate Java standard assertions for a specific method delimited by triple quotes ("""). The purpose of these assertions is to ensure the desired behavior of the method.
Use the following instruction set when generating the output:
Generate Java standard assertions for the given specified method.
Each line of the method has a line number.
Do not generate JUnit assertions. Your assertions must be in the form of Java standard assertions.
Do not use any symbols or methods that have not been defined in the project.
Output only the assertions along with the line numbers at which the assertions should be inserted.
Do not generate the new method and only focus on generating Java standard assertion and line number pairs.
Each pair of inferences must be within <JAVA> and </JAVA> tags and is a parenthesis of line number and assertion. For instance: <JAVA>(3, assert a<3;)</JAVA>, <JAVA>(5, assert a.getAge()==4;)</JAVA>.
Assume that all the necessary code and dependencies are already available, so you don't need to provide any additional code, packages, or dependencies, except the pairs of assertions.
Focus solely on generating assertions for the method to validate specific conditions and ensure the generated assertions will not change the method's behavior.
Ensure that the assertions are compilable in Java after being added to the method.
Exclude any methods, descriptions, or texts from your output, except the pairs of line numbers and assertions.
